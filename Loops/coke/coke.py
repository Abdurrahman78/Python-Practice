#implement a program that prompts the user to insert a coin, one at a time, each time informing the user of the amount due.
#Once the user has inputted at least 50 cents, output how many cents in change the user is owed. Assume that the user will only input integers,
#and ignore any integer that isnâ€™t an accepted denomination.
