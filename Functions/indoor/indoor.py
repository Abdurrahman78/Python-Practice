#implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase.
# Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged. Youâ€™re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly,
# as by passing a str of your own as an argument to input.

# prompts the user for input and changes input to lowercase
string=input("Enter a Word: ").lower()
#outputs the input given
print(string)
